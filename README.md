# üìäCustomer Sales Data Analysis with SQL

## üìù Project Overview

This project involves the creation and analysis of a customer sales database using SQL. The primary objectives are:
- **Data Modeling**: Designing a relational database to store customer sales information.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing or null values.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting meaningful insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and aggregate functions for complex queries.\
## Table Creation Script:
```mysql

create table customer_sales.customer_sales_data 
( 
customer_id	varchar(20),
product  varchar(50),
amount	float,
mode_of_payment varchar(40),
category	varchar(20),
feedback	varchar(20),
order_datetime	datetime,
delivery_datetime datetime
);

```
## üßπ Data Cleaning
To ensure data integrity, we checked for null values across all columns:
```mysql
select *
from customer_sales_data
where 
customer_id is null 
or
product is null
or   
amount is null 
or
mode_of_payment is null
or
category is null
or
feedback is null
or
order_datetime is null 
or
delivery_datetime is null;  
```
**Result:** No null values were found, indicating a clean dataset.

Adding new column total_data
```mysql
alter table customer_sales_data
add total_date int;
```
Adding primery key
```mysql
alter table customer_sales_data
add column id int not null auto_increment primary key;
```
Uptodate column 
```mysql
set sql_safe_updates=0;
update customer_sales_data
set total_date = timestampdiff(day, order_datetime,delivery_datetime)
where total_date is null and id is not null;
set sql_safe_updates=1;
```
## üìà Data Analysis
### 1. Total Sales by Product
Calculates the total sales amount for each product:
```mysql
select 
product as product,
round(sum(amount), 2) as total_sale
from  customer_sales_data
group by 1;
```
## 2. Average Delivery Duration and Amount
Determines the average delivery time and average purchase amount:
```mysql
select 
round(avg(total_date),2) as average_day,
round(avg(amount),2) as avg_total
from customer_sales_data;
```
## 3. Products with Most Positive and Negative Reviews

Identifies the products with the highest number of positive and negative feedbacks:

```mysql
select
(select 
product
from customer_sales_data
where feedback = 'Positive'
group by 1
order by count(*) desc
limit 1) as positive_review,            

(select product
from customer_sales_data
where feedback = 'Negative'
group by 1
order by count(*) desc
limit 1) as negative_review;
```
## 4. Most Popular Product, Category, and Payment Mode

Finds the most frequently purchased product, category, and commonly used payment method:

```mysql
select 
(select
product
from customer_sales_data
group by 1
order by count(*) desc
limit 1
) as most_product,
(select
category
from customer_sales_data
group by 1
order by count(*) desc
limit 1
) as most_popular_category,
(select
mode_of_payment
from customer_sales_data
group by 1
order by count(*) desc
limit 1
) as most_used_payment;
```
## 5. Top 5 Categories with Their Top 5 Products

Analyzes the top 5 categories and their respective top 5 products based on sales count and average amount:

```mysql
-- topcategory table contain top 5 category
with topcategory as (
select
category
from customer_sales_data
group by 1
order by count(*) desc
limit 5
),
-- categoryproducts table contain category with there top products with avg amount and product count 
categoryproducts as(
select
t.category,
t.product,
count(*) as product_count,
round(avg(t.amount), 2) as avg_amount,
row_number() over (partition by t.category order by count(*) desc) as rn
from customer_sales_data t
join topcategory tc on t.category = tc.category
group by t.category, t.product
)
-- top 5 category with each category have 5 products , product count and there avg amount
select category, product, product_count, avg_amount
from categoryproducts
where rn <= 5
order by category, product_count desc;

```

## 6. Bottom 5 Categories with Their Top 5 Products

Similar to the previous analysis but focuses on the least popular categories:

```mysql

with rank_category as (
select 
category, 
count(*) as order_count,
rank() over (order by count(*) asc) as rnk
from customer_sales_data
group by category

),
bottomcategory as (
select
 category
 from rank_category
 where rnk <= 5
),

categoryproducts as (
select
t.category,
t.product,
count(*) as product_count,
row_number() over (partition by t.category order by count(*) desc) as rn,
round(avg(t.amount), 2) as avg_amount
from customer_sales_data t
join bottomcategory bc on t.category = bc.category
group by t.category, t.product
)

select category, product, product_count, avg_amount
from categoryproducts
where rn <= 5
order by category, product_count desc;
```
## 7. Customer with Most Negative Feedback and Their Most Criticized Product

Identifies the customer who gave the most negative feedback and the product they criticized the most:

```mysql
WITH neg_customer AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_neg_count
    FROM customer_sales_data
    WHERE feedback = 'Negative'
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
customer_rank AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        total_neg_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_neg_count DESC, customer_id ASC) AS rn
    FROM neg_customer
),
top_product AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        product,
        COUNT(*) AS product_count
    FROM customer_sales_data
    WHERE feedback = 'Negative'
      AND customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM customer_rank WHERE rn = 1)
    GROUP BY customer_id, product
    ORDER BY product_count DESC, product ASC
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT 
    cr.customer_id,
    tp.product AS most_negative_review, 
    cr.total_neg_count,
    tp.product_count
FROM customer_rank cr
LEFT JOIN top_product tp ON cr.customer_id = tp.customer_id
WHERE cr.rn = 1;

```

## 8. Customer with Most Positive Feedback and Their Favorite Product

Identifies the customer who gave the most positive feedback and their most praised product:

```mysql
WITH positive_customer AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_pos_count
    FROM customer_sales_data
    WHERE feedback = 'Positive'
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
customer_rank AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        total_pos_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_pos_count DESC, customer_id ASC) AS rn
    FROM  positive_customer
),
top_product AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        product,
        COUNT(*) AS product_count
    FROM customer_sales_data
    WHERE feedback = 'Positive'
      AND customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM customer_rank WHERE rn = 1)
    GROUP BY customer_id, product
    ORDER BY product_count DESC, product ASC
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT 
    cr.customer_id,
    tp.product AS most_negative_review, 
    cr.total_pos_count,
    tp.product_count
FROM customer_rank cr
LEFT JOIN top_product tp ON cr.customer_id = tp.customer_id
WHERE cr.rn = 1;
```

## 9. Month with Highest Sales and Order Count

Determines the month with the highest total sales and the highest number of orders:

```mysql
select 
extract(year from order_datetime) as year,
extract(month from order_datetime) as month,
count(*) as order_count,
round(sum(amount), 2) as total_sale
from customer_sales_data
group by 
year, month
order by 
order_count desc, total_sale desc
limit 1;
```
## 10. Detailed Customer Purchase Analysis

Provides detailed insights into a specific customer's purchasing behavior:

```mysql
select
customer_id,
category,
round(sum(amount), 2) as total_spend,
count(*) as order_count
from customer_sales_data
where customer_id = 'CUST00277'
group by category
order by 
category desc, total_spend desc, order_count;
```
**Note:** Replace 'CUST00277' with the desired customer_id.
